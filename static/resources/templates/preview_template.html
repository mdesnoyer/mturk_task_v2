<center><p><b>FINDING {% filter upper %}{{ attribute }}{% endfilter %} IMAGES</b></p></center>

<p>You are about to participate in an a psychological experiment to gather data about the {% filter upper %}{{ attribute }}{% endfilter %}-ness of images. You will see multiple groups of images, one after the other. Your job will change depending on the section; in some sections, you will choose the most {% filter upper %}{{ attribute }}{% endfilter %} image out of that group, in others you will chose the least {% filter upper %}{{ attribute }}{% endfilter %}. However, in some HITs, you may be asked to only choose the most {% filter upper %}{{ attribute }}{% endfilter %}, or only choose the least. This is done very simply: you just click on the image, and you will go on to the next set of images.</p>
