        <p>Unfortunately, you did not pass the practice. Don't worry though,
        the HIT will still be accepted and you will still be paid. And you
        may be able to try again. You can continue to attempt to pass
        practices until your practice quota is used up. If you can't pass any
        practices before your quota is used up, don't worry: you can try again
        next week.
