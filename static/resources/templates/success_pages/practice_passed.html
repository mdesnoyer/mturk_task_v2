        <p>Congratulations! You have passed the practice. You may now
            proceed to completing the main HITs, which are listed under
            {{ jg['task_name'] }}. <font color="red">WARNING: Do not attempt to take another
            practice HIT! You will be unable to submit it.</font> Mechanical
        Turk occasionally takes too long to register the change in your
            qualifications, and may allow you to take another, however, this
        is in error and you will obtain an error page when you try to submit
        it!</p>
        <p>Click below to submit the HIT.</p>
        <button onclick="sendData();">Submit HIT</button>
