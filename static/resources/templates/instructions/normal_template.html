    IMAGES</b></p></center>

<p>You are about to participate in an a psychological experiment to gather
    data about the {% filter upper %}{{ attribute }}{% endfilter %}-ness of
    images. You will see multiple groups of images, one after the other. Your
    job will change depending on the section; in some sections, you will
    choose the most {% filter upper %}{{ attribute }}{% endfilter %} image
    out of that group, in others you will chose the least
    {% filter upper %}{{ attribute }}{% endfilter %}. However, in some HITs,
    you may be asked
    to only choose the most {% filter upper %}{{ attribute }}{% endfilter %},
    or only choose the least. This is done very simply: you just click on the
    image, and you will go on to the next set of images. Hit <b>Next</b> to
    begin.
