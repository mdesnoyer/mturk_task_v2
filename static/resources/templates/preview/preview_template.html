<p>You are about to participate in an a psychological experiment to gather data
    about the {% filter upper %}{{ jg['attribute'] }}{% endfilter %}-ness of
    images. You will see multiple groups of images, one after the other. Your
    job will change depending on the section; in some sections, you will
    choose the most {% filter upper %}{{ jg['attribute'] }}{% endfilter %}
    image out of that group, in others you will chose the least
    {% filter upper %}{{ jg['attribute'] }}{% endfilter %}. This is done very
    simply: you just click on the image, and you will go on to the next set
    of images. <b>This task will take NO LONGER THAN {{ task_time }} to complete, and probably much less.</b>
What we mean by {% filter upper %}{{ jg['attribute'] }}{% endfilter %} will be explained in the instructions.
All of our HITs are <b>automatically accepted</b> immediately, although there may be a delay because of MTurk.</p>
