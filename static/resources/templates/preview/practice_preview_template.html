<center><p><b>PRACTICE FINDING {% filter upper %}{{ jg['attribute'] }}{% endfilter %}
    IMAGES</b></p></center>

<p>This is a training / practice task that will prepare you to
    participate in a psychological experiment to gather data about the
    {% filter upper %}{{ jg['attribute'] }}{% endfilter %}-ness of images. Once
    you have completed it, you will be able to take the main task, which is
    called {{ jg['main_task_name'] }}. You will
    see multiple groups of images, one after the other. Your job will change
    depending on the section; in some sections, you will choose the most
    {% filter upper %}{{ jg['attribute'] }}{% endfilter %} image out of that group,
    in others you will chose the least
    {% filter upper %}{{ jg['attribute'] }}{% endfilter %}. However, in some HITs,
    you may be asked to only choose the most
    {% filter upper %}{{ jg['attribute'] }}{% endfilter %}, or only choose the
    least. This is done very simply: you just click on the image, and
    you will go on to the next set of images.</p>
