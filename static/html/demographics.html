        <p>Welcome to our study! In all of our HITs, you will observe a
            series of images and make choices about them. This is the practice
            module, for which you will be paid and will only need to complete
            successfully once.</p>
        <p>
            Before you begin, you must answer some simple demographic
            questions. You will only have to do this once for any of our HITs.
