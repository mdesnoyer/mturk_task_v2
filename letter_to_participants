Hello Turkers-

Thank you again for participating in our study. A number of you have asked when we will be resuming data collection. The answer is, very soon. However, there have been a number of changes made, which I will outline now:

- Unbanning: Those who have received temporary bans will be unbanned tonight at 12 am UTC, which is 7pm Eastern time, 5pm Pacific Time. You will have to re-take the practice.

- Slowing Down Data Aquisition: We are very appreciative of how willing our participants have been to complete our task. However, we will be decreasing the number of HITs posted per week from unlimited to around 4,000 / week. To ensure that everyone who wants to is able to participate, we will be decreasing the number of HITs you are allowed to complete per day.

- Preventing Exploitating: As many of you know, we had some trouble with users attempting to exploit our tasks. To prevent this, we have put additional measure into place. You won't notice a change beyond it taking slightly longer for the HITs to load. Unfortunately, this is unavoidable. But thank you again for all of your advice and attempts to help.

- More Time For Choices: We will be increasing the amount of time you have to make your decisions. However, as always, the reward is pegged to the average time it takes users to complete the HIT and you are still expected to work as quickly as you can. 

We will begin a test run of the HITs soon to ensure that the exploitation detection works correctly. The test run will be limited, but if you particpate and notice any errors or bugs, please contact us immediately. As always, do not heistate to contact us if you have any questions.
